Hello!  

I am a Comp Sci student, and this is my first time using GitHub (obviously).
I have experience in Java, C#, C++, Scheme, and Prolog.
Virtual Reality is a major interest of mine, and I am working on developing VR applications and games.
Aside from programming, I play piano and run every day.
